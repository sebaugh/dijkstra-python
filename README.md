# Dijkstra Algorithm Implementation

A Python implementation of Dijkstra's Algorithm designed to find the shortest path between cities. This project includes a utility to generate a full distance matrix using **Pandas**.

## 📂 Project Structure
- `dijkstra.py`: Core algorithm and distance matrix of all cities to all cities.
- `data/memphis_graph.json`: Sample graph data from one of the classes I took.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies.

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
